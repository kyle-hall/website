  <h1>Week Notes 002</h1>
  <p>Alright, it's been another week, so here's another week notes</p>

  <h2>The Week</h2>
  <p>
    The team got a lot done at work this week. Lots of meetings but I'm working on getting out of
    being the default meeting attender. Gotta delegate that out to people I know I can count on to
    handle things. Still, lots of good conversations and lots of progress made on putting this team
    together and getting it really cooking. Even did some mobbing to get everyone up-to-speed on
    this tech stack we're all fairly unfamiliar with, and that was really successful.
  </p>
  <p>
    Something I've had on my mind a lot this week is how to build a positive, healthy team culture.
    I was able to participate in and help build on my last team, but each team is different, so it
    feels like I'm back at square one with this new team. If you have any stories from teams with
    good culture or suggestions on things that help build a good culture, tweet them at me, please.s
  </p>
  <p>
    On the side, I didn't get anything done on my audio visualizer this past week. I've been
    painting or crashing on the couch with a book or TV. Even with a lighter week at work, still
    haven't been sleeping the best, so I've been trying to take it easy. Hopefully, I'll be able to
    work on it this weekend while the kids are napping.

        This was just some fun, fringe stuff that I thought was cool and funny at the same time. It
        comes up in the whole "CSS is not a programming language" argument, so I enjoyed this demo
        that it actually can do that. Not that CSS needs to be able to do that to be a programming
        language. It just is, no question, database connectsion or no.

        >Using Google Fonts Breaches GDPR</a

      <p>
        Europe is really giving Google a kicking, lately. And this IP thing is pretty gross. I need
        to get rid of the google fonts links on my site after reading this.

      >
      <p>
        Stats aren't normally my strong-suit, but this was a fun read. Goes into a lot of the
        problems with making general statements from non-representative samplings.

      <a href="https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/">A11y Project Checklist</a>
      <p>
        I've heard before that a11y is not a checklist, so I'm getting mixed signals here, but this
        information is super helpful and presented so well.
