  <h2>The Week</h2>
  <p>
    I've got less to say, overall, this week. After the doozy of a week I had last week, I took some
    advice and took a couple days off. It was nice. I hadn't really taken any time off since
    Christmas other than the odd day here or there to take of sick kids, so I was definitely due. I
    worked on a story I'm trying to write and painted a little in the afternoons while my daughter
    napped. Made some really tasty english muffins, too. The time was pretty nice, and I need to
    remember to take that time more often than every three months. I'm really looking forward to the
    warming weather, as I want to do some more plein air painting this year.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the days I was at work, it still feels like more of the same. I'm trying to find ways to
    avoid my past mistakes, and keep this team moving towards our goals. We received a challenge to
    think about how we can strip down the experience, using some out-of-the-box pages from the tool
    we're using, and really deliver on a full, end-to-end experience that achieves our goals in as
    little time as possible. And I'll say I think I did a good job of wrangling that and getting the
    team a path forward. We talked through the scope of the experience we needed to complete. We
    listed out the things that were already done, and then I lead us through a conversation that
    focused very narrowly on what we really actually needed to do to meet the challenge we'd been
    given. And that's something I'm proud of, which is difficult for me to allow myself to admit. I
    don't think it's a conversation I would have handled as well even 6 or 8 months ago, so I'm
    pretty happy with how that went. Tomorrow, we'll find out how this went when the rubber met the
    road, but I did what I could to ensure our success and have to let go of the need to control the
    actions of others.
  </p>
  <p>I think I'll leave it there. Here's hoping next week will be better.</p>

        Michelle Barker's really cool demo of the new :has() selector. Unfortunately, the full demo
        only works in Safari. The pen itself is still quite functional in whatever browser you're
        using.

        This seems like it's getting some traction, but it is very much not my jam. Reminds me too
        much of Java/Spring with all of its annotation-ridden classes. Just my opinion, though. I
        biased towards functional programming, generally.

        I thought this had some good ideas. I'm not sure I'd use all of the Node ones much, just
        because the projects at work tend to use different languages for the back-end.
