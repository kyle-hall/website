  <h1>Week Notes 006</h1>
  <p>
    This week was pretty good at work. Still maybe a few too many meetings, but such is life as a
    tech lead.

  <h2>The Week</h2>
  <p>
    As an update from last week, I'm feeling a bit better about things are going with my role as the
    tech lead on my current team. I got involved in a conversation about the value of test-driving
    an aspect of the project that hasn't been tested very much at all, which went really well.
    There's been some pushback on testing that bit, but I pretty clearly laid out the benefits of
    test-driving while, as far as I can tell, keeping my cool, which is something I definitely feel
    is a quality of a good tech lead. I've also gotten some pretty positive feedback from the client
    and my account lead that what I've been doing is working, which definitely made me feel a lot
    better. I really thrive on feedback and an outside perspective, so it was really valuable to
    hear from them. Overall, definitely in a much better place on this than last week.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the project, we had a great demo here at the end of the sprint, and an even better retro.
    Retros are my favorite sprint cadence meeting. I really like getting together with the team and
    taking a good look at the last couple of weeks. As long as we're honest with our feedback for
    ourselves as a team and can feel comfortable bringing up things that aren't working, retros have
    such a tremendous effect on the health of the team.
  </p>
  <p>
    And I didn't get much done on my audio visualiser this week. I've been doing a lot of work on my
    house and getting ready for my son turning six in a couple weeks, so not really much downtime on
    the weekends to work on it. Hopefully, things will chill out in April, and I'll have a little
    more time to work on it.

        This is something I didn't really know much about, but looks like a great project. It's a
        big driver behind things like Flexbox and Grid getting such widespread support, and those
        things are great, so it's definitely worth a look.

        Another article from the wonderful Stephanie Eckles. I enjoyed reading through this, even as
        someone who isn't absolutely in love with SASS. I've used it quite a bit, just not a
        passionate defender of it.
