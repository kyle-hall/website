  <h1>Week Notes 005</h1>
  <p>This week held a lot of challenges and reflection for me.</p>

  <h2>The Week</h2>
  <p>
    Tired - and now sick - two weeks in a row. Might need to changes things up. I'm just not getting
    enough sleep, and the whole family got sick. Nothing serious, but sick kids don't sleep well,
    so I haven't been sleeping well.
  </p>
  <p>
    For work, something I'm noticing is so many things getting stuck at like 85 or 90% of the way
    done. We have some dependencies outside our control, but that's only for some of what we have
    going on. And we've made huge progress not only towards a milestone but in general as a team.
    Velocity as a term is often derided, but I think it can be valuable for a team to help gauge
    its own health and productivity. If a team uses it internally as a litmus test, and examines
    why a given sprint is higher or lower than a previous one, the team benefits and catches
    growing problems earlier on. And higher velocity is definitely something we're seeing this
    sprint, which I'm taking as a huge win. But, we are still seeing things sit at almost done for
    longer than I'd like. Maybe it just goes back to that idea that the last 10% of the work
    is the hardest? Something to talk about in our next retro, perhaps.
  </p>
  <p>
    The tech lead role has also been a lot this week. Got kind of low at the beginning of the week,
    feeling like I'm doing everything wrong. Feels like I'm saying too much when I should hang back
    and keeping quiet when I should step in. I don't know, maybe the tiredness is throwing me off
    my game.
  </p>
  <p>
    I just can't help comparing myself to some of the amazing tech leads I've had in the past.
    People who have been so expert in this field and deft at handling either the team, the client,
    or both. And I know I haven't been on the job as long as them, and they certainly had more
    leadership experience than me I do now. But it just feels like I'm not ready for that.
  </p>
  <p>
    I know the counter-argument to that is they had to start somewhere, and that I can get better
    with practice. Just feels like I'm making all the mistakes right now, and the impostor
    syndrome is hitting hard this week.
  </p>
  <p>
    And maybe this just means I haven't found my role - the particular aspect of the tech lead
    gig - that both suits me and that this team needs. Maybe I'm trying to fill too many roles.
    Maybe that's why I'm getting things wrong and not really feeling like I'm on top of everything
    as my past tech leads always appeared to be. I'm not ready to throw in the towel, but this
    week has certainly been a lot.

        I don't know as much about web components as I'd like, so I must admit, I didn't
        have a whole lot of context on why this was perceived as difficult. But the
        article is great.
