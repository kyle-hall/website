    After a really (really) long hiatus, I'm back and want to start blogging again. The last two years have not
    been conducive to me writing here as much as I would have liked. The pandemic took a big toll on me (and
    everyone else) and I just didn't want to spend even more time in front of my computer after sitting in the
    same spot day after day for my job. Things have been getting better for me, so I'd like to come back to
    this blog to talk about my job and developer experience again. This is the first in a new series of
    entries following the "Week Notes" trend that I'm definitely very late to. My intention is for this to be
    a fun way to share some things I've learned, a few links of interesting articles I've read, and things
    that are going on at my job as I complete work for clients. Thanks for reading!

  <h2>The Week</h2>
  <p>
    This week has been pretty stressful, to be honest. Sitting down to write this on a Thursday night, it's the first
    time all week I haven't felt super tired or stressed. I joined a new team at work last month, and
    officially took on the tech lead role (my first time!) with all of its responsibilities over the
    past week. It's been a big adjustment, and I'm definitely struggling with finding the right amount
    of doing things myself and leaning on others. It doesn't help that the tech stack is unfamiliar, so
    I'm learning that on top of helping build a new team. But, over the last couple days, we've really
    been rocking and that's brought my stress down quite a bit. Hopefully, we'll keep that rolling
    into next week and all the weeks after.
  </p>
  <p>
    With my stress coming down, I'm hoping to have time for the side-project I've been planning. I want to
    build a audio visualizer app using the WebAudio API. It seems like a fun thing to do, to kind of scratch
    that building things just for the sake of building them itch. I'll be posting about my progress once I
    get going on that.

  <h2>A little link roundup</h2>
  <p>
    The other main section part of this week notes series is posting some of the articles I've looked at
    and (mostly) read during the week. I'm going to cheat and include some from last week in this first
    list to have a bit more variety. I'm a bit of a magpie when it comes to these interesting articles
    around CSS, JS, UX Engineering, and the general craft or writing code. And over the past year or so,
    I've been sharing them in the various relevant channels in my work's Slack. So, I thought it would be
    nice to collect those and share them, for ease of finding them again in one place for future reference.
  </p>
  <p>
    I subscribe to a lot of newsletters and things that definitely provide links to way more articles than
    I'm going to list here. That's generally where I get the articles I read during the week. I'll only
    be posting the articles I found of particular interest to my own tastes, so I highly encourage you
    to check out the sources for these if that tickles your fancy.
  </p>
  <p>
    Most of the newsletters I subscribe to, such as <a href="">Front-end Focus</a>, are published by
    <a href="">Cooper Press</a>, and I've been a big fan for a long time. Other than that, I check out
    <a href="">CSS Tricks</a> most days, and <a href="">Codrops'</a> new collective each week. If you
    know about other cool newsletters, I'd love to hear about them.
    Please <a href="https://twitter.com/khalligans47">tweet</a> them at me!
  </p>
  <p>So, without further ado, here are this week's articles, in no particular order:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="https://css-tricks.com/cycle-through-classes-html-element/">Cycling Classes on HTML Elements</a>
      <p>Quick tip from CSS Tricks</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/win7appqual/use-the-meta-tag-to-ensure-future-compatibility">Compatibility Mode Prevent with Meta Tags</a>
      <p>This one was a new one for me. I'm probably a bit behind on my &lt;meta&gt; tag knowledge, so this was pretty cool to learn</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/01/web-frameworks-guide-part1/">Web Frameworks Guide</a>
      <p>
        I don't subscribe to the "everything should just be vanilla JS" idea, but being critical of the stuff
        we ship to a user is always a good thing in my book. This comparison of frameworks was thorough.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/inclusive-design/">Inclusive Design guide from Nielsen Norman Group</a>
      <p>
        Just jam-packed with great information. Still reading and digesting this one.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://jonyablonski.com/articles/2022/crafting-component-libraries-the-elements/">Crafting Component Libraries from Jon Yablonski</a>
      <p>
        Same here. Jon Yablonski is someone who's becoming more and more of who I read lately. Looking forward
        to the next part of this.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://doist.dev/posts/building-a-newbie-friendly-codebase">Crafting a Newbie-Friendly Codebase</a>
      <p>
        This one is my personal favorite for the week (and it got a lot of love in the work Slack, too).
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://css-irl.info/aspect-ratio-is-great/">Michelle Barker talking about aspect ratio</a>
      <p>
        Aspect-ratio in CSS is something I don't know a whole lot about, so I'm looking forward to getting
        more familiar with it. And Michelle Barker is so knowledgeable; her articles are always so well-written.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <a href="https://web.dev/building-an-adaptive-favicon/">Adam Argyle talking about adaptive favicons</a>
      <p>
        With dark-modes and all that taking the web by storm, this one looked good.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
