  <h1>Week Notes 004</h1>
  <p>Wow, a whole month of these.</p>

  <h2>The Week</h2>
  <p>
    I am writing this super tired, so probably a shorter article, overall. This week has had some
    wins but also dragged a whole bunch. We had a positive demo and really productive retro. Retros
    are probably my favorite cadence meeting because it gives the team a chance to reflect on itself
    and the process instead of just getting work done or worrying about what's going on with the
    client.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've also been having a lot of conversations about team culture this week. I personally have
    been pushing the idea of a "No BS" culture. I've tried to put that idea out there in norming
    sessions in the past where it applied to me as an individual. But with my newfound position of
    responsibility, I'm trying to make it bigger to encompass at least a little of the mindset of
    the whole team. I very much appreciate direct feedback and want people to come to me any time
    they have feedback for me. And I also believe in airing things out and addressing potential
    problems as quickly as possible. I don't like letting things fester and become so big they can't
    really be solved between just the two individuals anymore.
  </p>
  <p>
    A lot of my frustration this week has come from acceptance test setup for my new project and
    meetings. The acceptance tests finally got to a good spot today after most of a week of
    problems. We're running on selenium, which I'm not super happy about. I'd throw it away and
    start fresh if I could. I just never really have any luck with it; it's always a huge pain to
    get working in any reliable fashion. Playwright is the tool I've used the most, and I like it
    quite a bit, although I'm really interested in trying out Cypress.
  </p>
  <p>
    For the meetings frustrations, it's mostly been down to just getting the value out of a meeting
    it's supposed to provide and getting out. I really don't like it when meetings get off topic, or
    we start to belabor a point. I generally try to step in and get things back on track, but it can
    be difficult. Hopefully, we'll get better at this as the project goes on.

        Great article from Dave Rupert - of Paravel and Shoptalk Show fame - about the tension
        between creating what you need for today and building ahead for the future.

      >
      <p>
        Caused quite the stir in the great community and a 50+ comment thread in the work Slack
        around the value and purpose of the PRs. I personally think they're pretty valuable, but
        some very smart colleagues brought up some great points around mechanical processes, keeping
        branches as close to main as possible to reduce merge conflicts, and the joys of continuous
        deployment. Nuanced issue, but a great conversation.

      <p>
        Jen Simmons shared an image comparing the use of <code>!important</code> flags in CSS with
        and without the new cascade layers. Still wrapping my head around cascade layers, on the
        whole.

        I really liked this article because it was so practical. I'm going to try implementing these
        on my website soon. Not this weekend because we're traveling, but soon.
