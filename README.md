## Characteristics of My Ideal Personal Website

I haven't been happy with my website for awhile now, and I've been trying to figure out
how to change that. Overall, my disatisfaction comes from the fact that my website is
a React app, but really doesn't need to be. What I wanted when I started was a small website that loaded fast, but that I could author really easily. My hope was to use my
React experience to build a site quickly from small components, but still end up with
a static site comprised of mostly HTML and CSS.
