        In light of the recent, and not so recent, events surrounding the murders of George Floyd,
        Breona Taylor, Ahmaud Arbery, Tony McDade, and thousands of other Black people over the last
        four centuries, I'm shutting down my site for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The police murdered George Floyd in the street in broad daylight while they knew they were
        being filmed. The murderer who knelt on George Floyd's neck looks nonchalant, with his hands
        in his pockets, as George Floyd calls out that he can't breathe.

        This violence is horrific but not new. It is a stain on this country so old that it's hard
        to see where it stops. And I refuse to be complicit in that violence. Because it is not
        enough to not support white supremacy and the militarized police that are killing and
        gassing and beating people as I write this. As they have been all week, without any apparent
        shame. There are exactly two sides to this: You're either with the racist, fascist cops and
        their political allies, or your against them. There is no neutral. If you aren't explicitly
        and vocally against the people who are beating and hospitalizing peaceful protestors,
        protestors crying out for the rights of Black people to exist, you are allying with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stand for the Black Lives Matter movement. I fully support the peaceful protest of the
        abuses and violence that have been visited on Black people for longer than this country has
        existed. I support the defunding and re-structuring of police departments across this
        country, and the implementation of policies that will hold police accountable to the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        I condemn the violence of the police against the protests of the last week. I condemn the
        use of tear gas and rubber bullets being used to maim and kill. And I condemn the
        politicians and government officials who are not speaking out and calling for an end to this
        violence.
      </p>
      <p>I'm not the first to say these words, but they bear repeating:</p>
      <h2>If you aren't angry, you aren't paying attention.</h2>
      <p>If you are wondering what you can do to help, here's a short list:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First thing, if you are white: show up, shut up, and listen. Do not try to use this for
          your own benefit. This is not about you. Be an ally, voice your support, and help, but do
          not make this about you.
        </li>
        <li>
          Participate in a protest if you are able. Keep yourself safe by wearing a mask and other
          protective equipment (shatter-proof safety glasses, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Donate to organizations and funds supporting the BLM movement, if you have the means. Try
          to make your money go farther by looking for matching donations. As of the time of writing
          <a href="https://www.netlify.com/donation-matching">Netlify</a>
          is one company I know of matching funds. Also, try to focus on local efforts like your
          local bail fund.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Be safe, and let's work towards a better future.</p>
