  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <p>
    Hey, y'all. I've been working on more React as I gear up for a new project at work, and I
    decided to try my hand at setting a React project from scratch.
    <span class="inset-code-sample">create-react-app</span> is cool for getting started
    quickly, but usually leaves me with a project that's got too much going on for me. I usually
    put up with that because I don't want to deal with creating my own Webpack config. But, with
    the advent of <a href="https://parceljs.org">Parcel.js</a>, I don't need to worry about
    that. So, let's get started.
  </p>
  <p>
    Small disclaimer: I'm going to use Yarn throughout this article, and I won't be showing the
    equivalent commands using npm. This is for the sake of brevity. In case, you'd like one,
    here's a quick conversion guide:
  </p>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
yarn add == npm install

yarn remove == npm uninstall
    </code>
  </pre>
</header>
<section>
  <h2>Step One: The Base</h2>
  <p>First, we need a project:</p>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
> mkdir my-awesome-manual-react-project && cd my-awesome-manual-react-project 

> yarn init -y      
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>Cool. Now that we have a project, let's install some stuff:</p>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
> yarn add @babel/core @babel/cli @babel/preset-env @babel/preset-react --dev

> yarn add parcel-bundler --dev 
        
> yarn add react react-dom
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    These installs give us a <em>lot</em> of stuff. We get React and react-dom, which is good
    since that's the kind of project we're building. We get Parcel which is going to handle all
    of the build layer for us, which is really great. We will not be writing a single line of
    config for Parcel. It has sensible defaults for bundling the application, including code
    splitting in the production build, which means we don't need to do a thing to get going.
    Lastly, we get Babel along with some presets for ensuring browser compatibility and proper
    transformations for our React code. Babel, if you don't know, is a language transformer for
    JavaScript that makes it possible to use many future or unstable features of the language
    today, as well as rewriting your ES6+ code to work in older browsers.
  </p>
  <p>
    For Babel, we will need a little bit of a config. But, it's a little baby config, really.
    Only three lines:
  </p>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
// .babelrc

{
  "presets": ["@babel/preset-env", "@babel/preset-react"]
}
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>Next, we'll add a couple scripts to start and build the app to our package.json:</p>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
{
  // ...the rest of your package.json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "parcel index.html",
    "build": "parcel build index.html"
  }
}
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    That's cool, but we still don't have an app, yet, just a bunch of other people's code. Let's
    fix that by creating an index.html and an index.js:
  </p>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
// index.html at the root of the project
    
{{'<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge" />
    <title>Parcel.js React project!</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="app"></div>

    <script src="./index.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>' | escape }}
    </code>
  </pre>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
// index.js file at the root of the project

import React from 'react'
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'

import App from './src/App'

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.querySelector('#app'))
    </code>
  </pre>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
// src/App.js

import React from 'react'
import GameboyImage from './img/gameboy.svg'

const App = props => (
  {{ '<div>
    <h1>Hello React App</h1> 
    <img src={GameboyImage} alt='a cartoon gameboy' width='200' height='200'/>
  </div>' | escape }}
)
    
export default App
        
// image available from 'https://pixelbuddha.net/freebie/nerd-free-flat-icons'
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    That should give us a really simple app. Let's find out. Start it up with
    <span class="inset-code-sample">yarn start</span> and load up
    <span class="inset-code-sample">http://localhost:1234</span> in your browswer. You
    should see our welcome message.
  </p>
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> The port <span class="inset-code-sample">1234</span> is the default for
    Parcel's dev server.
  </p>
  <p>
    And that's pretty cool. A (fledgling) app in a couple minutes with no configuration for
    building and no separate development server needed to get hot-module reloading. Fantastic.
  </p>
  <p>But, there's still something missing... Tests!</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2>Step Two: The Tests</h2>
  <p>Same as the step before, we'll start by installing some dependencies:</p>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
yarn add jest babel-jest enzyme enzyme-adapter-react-16 --dev
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    When that's done installing, we need to configure Jest a little bit so our code gets
    transformed correctly before the tests run:
  </p>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
// in package.json

"scripts": {
  // ...those scripts from above,
  "test": "jest",
  "watch": "jest --watchAll"
}
"jest": {
  "setupFilesAfterEnv": [
    "<rootDir>/jest.setup.js"
  ],
  "transform": {
    "^.+\\.js$": "babel-jest"
  }
}
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    This tells Jest to use Babel to transform all our React code before running the tests. Jest
    will throw some weird errors if you forget this step. Then, because we're using Enzyme, we
    need a setup file to initialize it at the beginning of all of the tests. But, we don't have
    one of those, so let's get that in there:
  </p>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
// <rootDir>/jest.setup.js

const Enzyme = require('enzyme')
const Adapter = require('enzyme-adapter-react-16')

Enzyme.configure({ adapter: new Adapter() })
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    <em>Note:</em> Normally, I would like to the
    <span class="inset-code-sample">import/export</span> syntax to get enyzme and the
    adapter. However, this jest setup file is run with Node, which doesn't support that syntax,
    yet. It is possible to make this work, but requires we install a few other things, so I'm
    not going to include it in this guide.
  </p>
  <p>With all of that done, we can write our first test:</p>
  <pre class="code-example">
    <code>
// App.spec.js

import React from 'react'
import { shallow } from 'enzyme'
import App from './App'

describe('App', () => {
  it('should render without crashing', () => {
    const wrapper = shallow(<App />)

    expect(wrapper).toBeTruthy()
  })
})
    </code>
  </pre>
  <p>
    Not a very valuable test, but it should validate our test setup is working. So, let's try it
    out. Run <span class="inset-code-sample">yarn test</span> in your terminal, and...
  </p>

    alt="black and white gif of plane crashing into hill"
  />
  <p>
    That didn't quite work. Why? Because Jest doesn't know what to do with the SVG. I tried a
    few different solutions for this:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Creating a file mock</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>
            Create a folder called __mocks__ (I think that's just a convention, not something
            that's actually required) at the root of your project
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Add a file called <span class="inset-code-sample">fileMock.js</span> and add
            <span class="inset-code-sample">module.exports = 'file-stub'</span>
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>Add this option to your jest config in your package.json:</p>
          <pre class="code-example">
            <code>
// in package.json

"jest": {
  "transform": {
    // ...the transform we added earlier
    "moduleNameMapper": {
      "\\.(svg)$": "<rootDir>/__mocks__/fileMock.js"
    }
  }
}
            </code>
          </pre>
          <p>
            This didn't work for me, and, I'm not 100% on this, I think it might be because I'm
            using Parcel.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>'identity-obj-mock'</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <span class="inset-code-sample">> yarn add identity-obj-mock --dev</span>
        </li>
        <li>
          Use the same moduleNameMapper option from above but set the value to
          "identity-obj-mock"
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>This also didn't work for me, but I have no idea why.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Create your own transformer:</h4>
      <pre class="code-example">
        <code>
// assetTransformers/genericTransformer.js

module.exports = {
  process() {
    return 'module.exports = {}'
  },
  getCacheKey() {
    return 'genericTransformer'
  }
}
        </code>
      </pre>
      <p>
        Use the same "moduleNameMapper" option as the last two solutions and set the value to
        the path to this transfomer (mine was
        '&lt;rootDir&gt;/assetTransformers/genericTransformer.js' )
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what ultimately worked for me. You can add file extensions to the regex as
        needed.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>With that, the tests, should run and pass!</p>

    I hope you found this guide helpful. It was fun to put together, and I certainly felt
    accomplished when I figured it out. Thanks for reading; see you in the next one.
