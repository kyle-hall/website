        Happy (belated) New Year! And welcome! I have been on a hiatus of sorts for the last few
        months, but with the new year I'm getting back into blogging. As my first article for the
        year, I'll be writing about my hiatus as well as my focus and goals for the year to come.

      <h2>Re-Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Hi, my name is Kyle Hall, and I'm a software developer from Iowa in the United States. I
        have been working as a developer for the last 4 and half years, and I currently work for
        Pillar Technologies, a part of the Industry X.O group.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally, I have a lot of interests in software development, but I love the web and I am
        trying to focus on front-end development right now. I have used React a lot, and I'm
        branching out into learning Vue (for philosophical reasons I'll be talking about in an
        upcoming article). I'm also trying to get better at styling and layout with CSS and HTML.
        And I care <em>a lot</em> about creating great website and web applications that are built
        well and can be used and enjoyed by as many people as possible.

      <h2>My Hiatus</h2>
      <p>
        I started blogging last year, and I was presently surprised by the response I got. But,
        about halfway through the year, I got a whole new set of priorities. My wife gave birth to
        our second child, Lucia! She was born in July, and we are so happy she's here with us.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luckily, I was able to take a sizeable amount of time off from work, and I made the decision
        that I wouldn't be programming or blogging at all while I was home. After I went back to
        work in September, I intended to start blogging again, but finding time with both hands free
        to type up articles was difficult with a 3 year-old and 3 month-old to take care of in the
        evenings. Then, the holidays loomed, and I just knew I wouldn't be getting any blogging done
        at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, really, this was fine. I enjoyed the time off and the opportunity to focus on other
        things. But, coming into the new year, I knew I wanted to start blogging about the things
        I've been learning again. So, this article is the first of many to come throughout the year,
        and I'm excited to have the opportunity to share my experiences and knowledge with you, my
        dear reader.
