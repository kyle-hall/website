    <p>
      Hi, I'm Kyle Hall. I'm a fullstack software developer working out of Des Moines, Iowa in the
      United States. I've been working as a developer for nearly 4 years now. In that time, I've
      worked with many different programming languages and tech stacks, including Java, Scala, C#,
      and JavaScript. I love the web, and that's where I like to spend most of my time. I have
      worked with React, Vue, and a little bit of Angular, and I prefer React right now. I've also
      done some mobile development using React-Native. Right now, I'm passionate about mastering the
      programming of anything you could see in a browser. Mostly that means I'm trying to get better
      at CSS and HTML. Thank you for your interest in my blog.
